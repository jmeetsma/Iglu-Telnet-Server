Iglu Telnet Server is a command line telnet server written in Java.
It provides a convenient way to create a backdoor in any Java server
environment, such as JEE-solutions.

This project contains sample implementations, using various components
from Iglu Common: a socket server, a telnet adapter and command line invocation
of objects. It demonstrates how to to make an object command line invokable by a
telnet client.

The Iglu Project explores simple and robust solutions for enterprise applications.
Iglu is developed and maintained by Jeroen Meetsma, partner at IJsberg.

GETTING STARTED

You'll need a Java SDK 1.6 or higher to build the project.

1. Download sources from GitHub.
2. Build project with Maven, or create a build configuration of your own.
3. Examine and try provided samples of a server setup.

N.B. The Maven build provided will also create a working distribution of a standalone server.


SERVER SETUP

This distribution contain two samples to show you how a telnet server can be set up.

Sample 1: Set up an embedded telnet server.
The class EmbeddedServer demonstrates how to configure and start a telnet server that
can be embedded in your own code. EmbeddedServer can be run within an IDE so that you
can easily try things out.

Sample 2: Set up a standalone server environment.
The class StandaloneTelnetServerConfiguration contains the setup for a complete
runtime environment that can be run on a UNIX-like platform. It demonstrates that you don't
need an application server to host Java server applications.*)

It's easy to connect the telnet server to your own implementation. For both setups goes that you
simply have to substitute the SampleInvokableObject by a class of your own.

TESTING

A server can be started from your IDE or by invoking the startServer script in a command shell.
Connect to your server from a command shell by typing:

telnet localhost 17623

Windows doesn't provide telnet anymore, so you have to download Putty or some other telnet client.
Make sure you run Putty with the -telnet argument.



*) Iglu server configurations are perfectly suitable to run in an AWS micro instance
